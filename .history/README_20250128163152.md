## Introduction

### Introduction:
This README provides an overview of the Microservices Project, an architecture that comprises multiple microservices to create a scalable and modular system. The project is designed to handle various aspects of a hypothetical e-commerce platform.

The project employs a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication between services to ensure efficient data exchange and scalability. The core technologies used in this project include `WebClient` for synchronous communication, Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging, Spring Cloud Netflix for service discovery, and Spring Cloud Gateway for the microservices gateway.

### Architecture diagram:
![Test Image 1](utils/architechture.png)

The architecture of this microservices project is designed to showcase both asynchronous (async) and synchronous (sync) communication patterns. The diagram illustrates the interactions between different services, utilizing a combination of RESTful APIs and event-driven communication.

#### Key Components:

1. **Microservices:**
    - Each box represents an individual microservice responsible for specific business functionalities.
    - Dotted lines represent asynchronous communication (e.g., Kafka messaging) between services, emphasizing the event-driven nature.

2. **API Gateway:**
    - The API Gateway is responsible for handling incoming requests from clients and directing them to the appropriate microservice.
    - It serves as a central entry point for external communication and can provide functionalities such as routing and load balancing.

#### Note:
- The diagram does not explicitly depict the Discovery Service, which plays a crucial role in service registration and discovery within a microservices architecture. Although not shown, the project includes a Discovery Service implementation.

## Services

The project consists of the following microservices:

1. **Product Service**: Manages product information, including product catalog and details.
2. **User Service**: Handles user management, authentication, and authorization.
3. **Cart Service**: Manages shopping carts, including adding, removing, and checking out items.
4. **Order Service**: Processes and manages customer orders.
5. **Inventory Service**: Manages product inventory levels.
6. **Notification Service**: Handles notifications to users, such as order confirmations and updates.
7. **Order Validation Service**: This service is responsible for validating incoming orders to ensure they meet certain criteria (enough products in the inventory).
8. **Order Validation Retry Service**: his service may handle retry mechanisms for orders in cause of an unjust refusal (if inventory service is down).
   Implements retry logic, such as periodic revalidation attempts.

Each microservice is designed to be self-contained and independently deployable, allowing for flexibility and scalability.

## Synchronous Communication

Synchronous communication is utilized for real-time interactions between services. This project uses the following technology:

- **WebClient**: Synchronous communication is achieved through the use of the Spring Framework's `WebClient`, which allows for HTTP-based communication between microservices. This is suitable for scenarios where immediate responses are required, such as retrieving product information or user data.

## Asynchronous Communication

Asynchronous communication is used to decouple services and ensure high availability. Apache Kafka is chosen as the messaging platform for asynchronous communication:

- **Kafka**: Apache Kafka is employed for message queuing and event streaming. It enables asynchronous interactions between microservices, such as handling order processing, inventory updates, and notifications, without the need for immediate responses. This architecture ensures scalability and fault tolerance.

## Service Discovery

Service discovery is essential for the dynamic registration and discovery of microservices. Spring Cloud Netflix is employed for this purpose:

- **Spring Cloud Netflix**: This framework provides service discovery capabilities through technologies like Netflix Eureka, allowing microservices to locate and communicate with one another dynamically. It enhances the resilience and scalability of the architecture.

## Microservices Gateway

A microservices gateway is used to route incoming requests to the appropriate microservice and manage cross-cutting concerns. Spring Cloud Gateway is chosen for this task:

- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway serves as a reverse proxy that handles routing, load balancing, and security. It acts as the entry point to the microservices architecture, providing a unified interface for client applications and handling tasks like authentication, rate limiting, and request routing.

With these technologies in place, the Microservices Project creates a robust and flexible architecture for building and scaling an e-commerce platform, ensuring reliable communication, high availability, and ease of management.

Please refer to the individual documentation of each microservice for specific implementation details and endpoints.
